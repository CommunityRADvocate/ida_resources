## Continued Learning
* [Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) | University of Helsinki](https://www.mooc.fi/en/)
    - Free online courses covering various topics, including [Data Analysis with Python](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/data-analysis-with-python-2023-2024), [Big Data Platforms](https://big-data-platforms-24.mooc.fi/), and several courses on the impact of AI in different sectors. Course list can be filtered for language and difficulty level.
* [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
    - Free courses with verified certifications, as well as coding interview prep and programming challenges on a wide range of technical skills.
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
    - There is financial aid available to those who qualify. Click 'Financial aid available' next to a course enrollment button.
    - If you want to go through the materials for a professional certificate course, but don'twant to pay for the certificate or don't qualify for financial aid, most such courses on the platform can be audited. When you click on the "Enroll for free" button, there should be a link at the very bottom (below the free trial button) to Audit the course. This will give you access to the videos and learning materials, but not allow you to take quizzes, post in the course forums, or receive the certificate. It's a great way to test out if you like the format of a course before paying for it, as well.
    - The [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course is the one I went through, so if you'd like to get your hands on learning R Programming, this is a good one. Again, you can just audit to gain access to the relevant sections.
